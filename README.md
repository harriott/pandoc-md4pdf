======

For `markdown` files containing up to five level of heading, here are three small resources for smoother conversion to pdf using `Pandoc` calling `XeLaTeX`.

### Requirements
- `LaTeX`, `Pandoc` and my adapted [pandoc-templates](https://github.com/harriott/pandoc-templates)
- `Linux`: environment variable `$MD4PDF` set to the the path of this file's directory
- `Windows 10`: a `pdf` viewer that doesn't lock the `pdf` file, such as `SumatraPDF`
